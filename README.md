# Chicken-Man
A simple game I made using the python pygame library

#### Requirements
If you use windows you can download an exe [here]( https://shabbyschick.itch.io/chicken-man-flight-wars)

Otherwise
You need to have python installed on your computer, if you dont then you can download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) After you've successfully completed that 
Run
$ pip install pygame
Clone the repo
The code should run hopefully, I haven't updated in a while
 
 #How to play
 
 1.Using the arrow buttons for control

2.up arrow buton for chicken to fly upwards, although his flight distance is limited

3.down arrow button to move back downwards, chicken will walk when hes on land

4.left and right arrow button to move left and righ ways, when flying chicken movement speed left or right ways increases a bit compared to when chicken is on land

5.use space bar to shoot enemys

#Enemies

"""1. Bird: They are quite easy to kill but spawn multiple amounts

2. RedKooba: They are here to cause trouble, you need two shots to kill these guys

3. Boss: He is quite a nuisance aswell but if you can get 10 eggs to hit him then you got em' lol
 
4. Also note that as time increase the enemys spawn faster and their movement increases"""


""" Feel free to play around with the code and do whattever you want with it. Hope you enjoy the game """
